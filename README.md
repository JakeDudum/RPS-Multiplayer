# RPS-Multiplayer

![alt text](assets/images/deployed.png "RPS-Multiplayer")

A website to browse gifs on with style. Users can click any of the premade buttons to load 10 gifs into the iphone display and then click them to play them and stop them. There is also a form on the right side of the site for users to add their own buttons to the list and then be able to click them as well. All of the gifs are loaded from the [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) website using their [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).
